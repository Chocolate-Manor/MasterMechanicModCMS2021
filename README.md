MASTER MECHANIC MOD - 1.0.0
CMS2021's Expert Mode disables visual prompts of car parts during unmount, but does not disable the x-ray of car parts during mount. To create a more authentic Expert experience, this mod removes the mount mode car parts x-rays as well.
Note you do not have to play on Expert Mode to use this mod. It will disable mount mode car parts x-rays regardless of your current game mode. So you can turn this mod on and practice mounting parts in order in normal mode as well.

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
To use MelonLoader 0.6, you must have .NET 6.0.

:: FEATURES ::
Turns off mount mode car part x-rays regardless of difficulty.
